## Installing Docker on Ubuntu 

You will need the following:
- One Ubuntu server set up, including a sudo non-root user and a firewall.
- An account on Docker Hub if you wish to create your own images and push them to Docker Hub.

1. Update your existing list of packages: `$ sudo apt update`

2. Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS: `$ sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common`

3. Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system: `$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`

4. Add the Docker repository to APT sources: `$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"`

5. Finally, install Docker: `$ sudo apt install docker-ce`

6. Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that itâ€™s running: `$ sudo systemctl status docker`

## Installing PyTest

1. Prerequisites

- Python Installation.
- Pip Installation.

2. Open your terminal and run the command: `pip install pytest`
